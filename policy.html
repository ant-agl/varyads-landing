        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">As used in this Policy, the term «personally identifiable information» means
          information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, user name or e-mail address and phone
          number), or information about that individual that is directly linked to information that specifically
          identifies an individual. Personally identifiable information does not include «aggregate» information, which
          is data we collect about the use of the Service or about a group or category of services or users, from which
          individual identities or other personally identifiable information has been removed. This Policy in no way
          restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">Active Collection: We collect information from you in various ways when you use the
          Service and/or Apps. For example, we collect information: (i) that you voluntarily provide to us (such as when
          you send us a phone number or email); and (ii) to which you provide us access. Such information may include
          personal information, such as your name, email address, date of birth, social network data and performance
          related data. When using our Apps we will collect information such as device type, operating system type and
          version. Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in
          connection with posting data, providing access to your online groups and other activities in connection with
          the Service.<br>
          We also ask you for access or track a location based information from your mobile device while downloading or
          using our Mobile Apps or services.<br>
          Passive Collection: When you use the Service and our Apps, some information is also automatically collected,
          such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a
          referring website, and your activity on the Service. We may also automatically collect certain logistical
          information in server logs, including information about how you use various features of the Service and
          information about the number, frequency and length of each session.<br>
          We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of «cookies» when you use the Service.

          graphic images that may be used on the Service or in emails relating to the Service to collect certain
          information and monitor user activity on the Service, such as to count visits, understand usage effectiveness
          and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. Such technologies are used to collect aggregate
          statistics related to usage of the Service and do not collect personally identifiable information.<br>

          identifiable information in the United States and other countries.</p>
