        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">1. What are cookies?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">Cookies are small text files placed on your computer or device as you browse the
          Internet. Cookies can be used
          to collect, store and share bits of information about your activities across websites, including on Varyads.
          They also allow us to remember things about your visit to Varyads, such as your preferred language and other
          choices/settings and generally make the site easier for you to use.
          Varyads uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie is used to identify a particular
          visit to our site. These cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser after using our
          services. We use these cookies to identify you during a single browsing session, such as when you log into
          Varyads. A persistent cookie will remain on your devices for a set period of time specified in the cookie. We
          use these cookies where we need to identify you over a longer period of time. For example, we would use a
          persistent cookie if you asked that we keep you signed in.</p>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">2. Why does Varyads use cookies and similar technologies?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">Varyads uses cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons or pixel tags, to
          deliver, measure, and
          improve our services in various ways.<br>
          We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">(a) Authentication and security:</h3>
        <ul class="impressum__text">
          <li>To log you into Varyads;</li>
          <li>To protect your security; and</li>
          <li>To help us detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate Varyadsâ€™s Terms Of Use (located
            at https://varyads.com/terms).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="impressum__text">For example, these technologies help authenticate your access to Varyads and prevent
          unauthorized parties from
          accessing your account. They also let us show you appropriate content through our services.</p>
        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">(b) Preferences:</h3>
        <ul class="impressum__text">
          <li>To remember information about your browser and your preferences; and</li>
          <li>To remember your settings and other choices you have made.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="impressum__text">For example, cookies help us remember your preferred language or the country that you
          are in. We can then
          provide you with Varyads content in your preferred language without having to ask you each time you visit
          Varyads.</p>
        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">(c) Analytics and research:</h3>
        <ul class="impressum__text">
          <li>To help us improve and understand how people use our services. For example, cookies help us test different
            versions of our services to see, which particular features or content users prefer. We may include web
            beacons in e-mail messages, newsletters or messages using Varyads to determine whether the message has been
            opened and for other analytics. We might also optimize and improve your experience on Varyads by using
            cookies to see how you interact with our services, such as when and how often you use them and what links
            you click on. To help us better understand how people use our services, we work with a number of analytics
            partners, including Google Analytics, Quantcast and Scorecard. To find out more about their cookies and the
            privacy choices they offer, please visit the following links:</li>

          <li>ScoreCard (https://www.scorecardresearch.com/privacy.aspx/)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">(d) Personalized content:</h3>
        <ul class="impressum__text">
          <li>To customize our services with more relevant content.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">(e) Advertising (Ads):</h3>
