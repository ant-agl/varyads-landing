        <p class="impressum__text">
          Effective Date: 2023-11-01

          0. In several countries of the world, companies are obliged by law to store personal data of their residents
          on
          servers within these countries. We don’t have any ability to do that, so we store such data in EU for now.
          Thus,
          we don’t allow users from such countries to use any of our Services. According to these Terms of Use, you must
          figure out if such law or regulation is applicable in your country on your own. In case it is applicable, you
          must not provide us with you personal data and/or must stop using the Service immediately. You agree that any
          consequences to us raised by your violation of this clause of the Terms of Use, including but not limited to,
          lawsuits expenditures, fines, fees and legal support expenditures may be fully transferred to you.
        </p>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">1. Important information</h3>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">1A. What are these Terms of Use?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">These terms (“TOU”) are part of the legal documents that govern your access to, and
          your use of Varyads if you
          use the site through the website or through the mobile apps (the “Services”).</p>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">1B. Why are these TOU important?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">By accessing, using, registering for or receiving any of the Services, you are
          agreeing to be bound by the terms
          and conditions of these TOU and to the Privacy Policy (located at https://varyads.com/policy) and Cookie
          Policy
          (located at https://varyads.com/cookie), which are incorporated herein by reference. You need to read them
          before you use or access the Services because these terms create a legally binding relationship between you as
          a
          user of the Services and Böhrer Innovations UG (haftungsbeschränkt) (“Varyads”, “we”, “our” or “us”).</p>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">1C. Who is Böhrer Innovations UG (haftungsbeschränkt)?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">Böhrer Innovations UG (haftungsbeschränkt) is a private limited company incorporated
          in Germany with company
          number HRB 741674 and its registered office Bunsenstr. 1, 76275 Ettlingen, Deutschland. Varyads is subject to
          Germany and EU law.</p>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">1D. I don’t understand these TOU, can Varyads help me?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">If there’s anything you don’t understand in the TOU (or anywhere else on the
          Services), please contact us using
          the contact information below.</p>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">1E. What if I don’t accept these TOU?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">If you don’t accept these TOU, you must stop using or accessing the Services.</p>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">1F. Do I need my parents’ consent to sign up or to use Varyads?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">If you are a minor, that means under the age of legal majority in your country, and
          are not an emancipated minor
          (in countries that permit this), you must have your parents’ or guardian’s consent to enter into these TOU and
          to use the Services, and by using the Services you are confirming that you have received that consent.</p>


        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">2. Who can use Varyads?</h3>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">2A. How old do I need to be?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">By accessing or using the Services you warrant (that is a legal word for promise and
          confirm) that you are at
          least 13 years old (or over the age of legal majority in your country, if higher) and you are fully able and
          competent to enter into and comply with these TOU.</p>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">2B. What if I am under 13?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">Sorry, but you can't use Varyads if you are under 13 years old. If you are under
          13 years of age, you are not
          permitted to access or use the Services. If we become aware that you are using the Services even though you
          are
          under 13 and not permitted to do so, we will deactivate your account and attempt to block you from accessing
          the
          Services.</p>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">2C. What laws do I need to follow?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">You are responsible for making sure you follow all laws and regulations in the
          country in which you live when
          you access and use the Services. By using the Services, you are confirming that you have not been convicted
          of,
          nor are you subject to any court order relating to, assault, violence, sexual misconduct or harassment.</p>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">2D. Do you do any background or criminal checks?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">We do not conduct any background checks on users, criminal or otherwise. You need
          to
          be careful when interacting
          with other people online.</p>


        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">3. Registering to use Varyads</h3>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">3A. Do I need to register to use the Services?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">To use some parts of the Services, you may be required to register for an account
          with us by providing certain
          information, including your name, phone numebr, e-mail address, nickname, country of residence and password.
          You
          agree to provide true and accurate information and to update it as necessary to keep it accurate. If you
          provide
          us with false information, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account.</p>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">3B. Can I register through my Facebook or similar accounts?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">You’ll need to check it by yourself, we are constantly improving our services.</p>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">3C. Can I share my account or my login details?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">No. Only you are allowed to access your account. You must keep your password
          (and/or
          similar entities such as
          one time code) confidential and, other than sharing it with your parent or guardian if you are a minor, you
          should not tell anyone your password or let anyone else access your account. Sharing your password (and/or
          similar entities such as one time code) might lead to all of your assets, posts, messages and personal
          information being leaked or someone impersonating or pretending to be you. If you don’t keep your password
          (and/or similar entities such as one time code) confidential or give it to anyone other than your parent or
          guardian, we are not responsible for anyone accessing or using your account, including reading or sending
          messages from it. If you think that someone else might be using your account, you must let us know
          immediately
          using the contact information below. Also you should also immediately change your password. We may terminate
          your account or block you from accessing the Services if you break the rules on keeping your password
          secure.
        </p>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">3D. Do I always need to enter my password?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">To provide you with ease of access to your account, we may implement technology
          that
          enables us to recognize
          your device and provides you with direct access to your account without requiring you to retype your
          password
          when you revisit the Services.</p>

          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">4B. Do you check my account and/or assets in it?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">You acknowledge that we have no obligation to monitor your access to or use of the
          Services for violations of
          the TOU or to review or edit any content. However, we have the right to do so for the purpose of operating and
          improving the Services (including without limitation for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation and
          customer support purposes), to ensure your compliance with the TOU and to comply with applicable law or the
          order or requirement of a court, consent decree, administrative agency or other governmental body. We can also
          block or respond to content that we determine is otherwise objectionable or as set forth in the TOU. In
          addition, you acknowledge that we have your consent to monitor and block content that we consider to be
          harassing or bullying, as well as block your account temporarily or permanently in such cases.</p>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">4C. Can you block any content I posted or created if I broke the rules?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">We reserve the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable
          access to any content for any
          reason or no reason. Some of the reasons we may remove or disable access to content may include finding the
          content objectionable, in violation of the TOU or otherwise harmful to the Services or our users.</p>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">4D. Who can see what I create or publish?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">When you publish anything using our Services, it can be seen or accessed by the
          general public as further
          described in our Privacy Policy (located at https://varyads.com/policy). An important thing to remember is
          that
          we may access, preserve or disclose any of your information, if we are required to do so by law or if we
          believe
          in good faith that it is reasonably necessary to (i) respond to claims asserted against us or to comply with
          legal process (for example, subpoenas or warrants), including those issued by courts having jurisdiction over
          us
          or you, (ii) enforce or administer our agreements with users, such as these TOU; (iii) for fraud prevention,
          risk assessment, investigation, customer support, providing the Services or engineering support, or (iv)
          protect
          the rights, property or safety of Varyads, the users of the Services, or members of the public.</p>


        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">5. Does Varyads own my content once I post it online?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">If you submit material to the Services, unless we indicate otherwise, you grant us a
          perpetual (for any type
          of
          messages you send only), non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully-paid-up, and fully sub-licensable right to
          access, view, use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute,
          copy,
          and display such material throughout the world in any form, media, or technology now known or hereafter
          developed. After publishing you also permit any other user to view, copy, access, store, or reproduce such
          material for that user’s personal use. You grant us the right to use the name or username that you submit in
          connection with such material. You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights
          to
          the material that you submit; that the material you submit is truthful and accurate; and that use of the
          material you supply does not violate these TOU, the rights of any third party, or any applicable laws. You
          unconditionally waive in favor of us all moral rights in respect of material you submit to the Services under
          any laws in force from time to time in any part of the world. If you leave the Services, your account
          information can be deleted, but your assets of any type will remain on the Services.</p>


        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">6. Can you ever change these terms of use?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">We may, at any time and for any reason make changes to these TOU. We may do this for
          a variety of reasons,
          including to reflect changes in or requirements of the law, new features, or changes in business practices.
          The
          most recent version of the TOU will be posted on the Services, and you should regularly check for the most
          recent version. The most recent version is the version that applies. If the changes include material changes
          that affect your rights or obligations, we will notify you of the changes by reasonable means, which could
          include notification through the Services or via email. If you continue to use the Services after the changes
          become effective, then you shall be deemed to have accepted those changes. If you don’t agree to these
          changes,
          you must end your relationship with us (without penalty) by ceasing to use the Services and leaving the
          Services. Additionally, if we update or upgrade the Services, you may be required to accept the most recent
          version of the TOU to access the updated or upgraded Services.</p>


        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">7. How can I or Varyads deactivate or terminate my account?</h3>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">7A. How do I deactivate my account?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">If you are a registered user of the Services, you can deactivate your membership at
          any time by sending an
          email
          to info@varyads.com with subject "deactivate profile" and mentioning your account phone number and short
          nickname (login, username) that starts with "@" in your profile settings. By deactivating your account, it
          will
          no longer be possible to create assets and use services of Varyads, but we’ll save your information in case
          you
          change your mind later and want to reactivate your account. Many members deactivate their accounts for
          temporary
          reasons and in doing so expect us to maintain their information until they return to the Services. You should,
          therefore, be able to restore your account and the whole of your profile within 12 months of deactivating it,
          but we cannot guarantee that this will always be the case.</p>

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">7B. How do I actually terminate my account, not just deactivate it?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">Should you choose to leave the Services, rather than deactivate your account, you may
          do so by sending an
          email
          to info@varyads.com from email of your account with subject "I want to leave Varyads" and mentioning your
          account email in body. Once received, we will process your request to leave as soon as practicable. Once
          processed, your profile data will be removed from the Services. You will be able to reactivate your account by
          logging back in for a period of 30 days after your request to leave the Services is processed. At the end of
          that period, your account will be deleted. We will delete your data as soon as reasonably practicable, but in
          certain cases, limited types of data, including log files and backups, may take up to 90 days to be fully
          deleted.
          Warning: After you have deactivated your account or left the Services some of your assets will remain visible
          as

          necessary information for notice verification. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that
          constitutes copyright infringement or that your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated,
          please provide Varyads’s Copyright Agent with a written communication containing the following information in

              you claim has been infringed, or if multiple works have been infringed, a representative list of such

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">(b) What happens to my copyright claim notice?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">In some circumstances, in order to notify the subscriber, account holder or host who
          provided the allegedly
          infringing content to which Varyads has disabled access (or intends to disable access), Varyads may forward a
          copy of your notification including your name and contact information to the subscriber or account holder. The
          individual may choose to file a counter-notification explaining why the content does not infringe an IP right
          following receipt of our notice. We may also, in our sole discretion, post a notice or a copy of your
          complaint
          on our site or in our mobile applications. By providing us with a complaint, you are consenting to your
          complaint being forwarded to the subscriber, account holder or host who provided the allegedly infringing

        <h3 class="impressum__subtitle">(c) What if I change my mind or make a false copyright claim?</h3>
        <p class="impressum__text">After submitting a copyright or other IP right, infringement notification, you may
          realize that you
          misidentified content or you might otherwise change your mind. Varyads will honour retractions of copyright or
          other IP claims from the party who originally submitted them. It is important that you do not make false
          claims.
          Submitting a claim of copyright or other IP right infringement is a serious matter with legal consequences.
          Before you report a claim of copyright or other IP right infringement to us, you may wish to reach out to the
          individual posting the content. You may be able to resolve the issue simply by bringing it to their attention
          without contacting us at all. If you are unsure whether the content you are reporting is infringing your legal
          rights, you may wish to seek legal guidance. Keep in mind that submitting intentionally misleading reports of
          infringement may be punishable under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the United States or
          similar
          laws in other countries.</p>
